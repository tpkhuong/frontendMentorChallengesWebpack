# Notes

once we connect a database to a mongoose schema then we change the schema in our model js file,
it will cause problems. We could only add one user data when we changed our User schema model from using
email to username.

---

MAKE SURE WE KNOW THE KEY/PROPERTY OF OUR SCHEMA BEFORE WE ADD DATA TO OUR DATABASE.

IF WE CHANGE OUR MIDE ABOUT THE KEY/PROPERTY WE WANT OUR SCHEMA TO HAVE, WE HAVE TO CONNECT OUR APP TO A DIFFERENT DATABASE.
OR FIND A WAY TO TELL MONGOOSE, MONGODB AND PASSPORT TO GET ALONG.
